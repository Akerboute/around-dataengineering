## Data is Coming :partying_face:

And the Data arrives. Well I have no idea, what is that data all about but just heard it will be around ~ 10 GB.
Well its gonna be structured, so it gonna be really easy to estimate, isn't it :relieved:

We all connected, and all of us were pretty much convinced on easy sql engine, maybe postgres and then we can simply run 
some basic query for data analysis.
